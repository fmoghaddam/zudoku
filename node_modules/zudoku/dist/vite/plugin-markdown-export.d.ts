 * This plugin exports markdown files (.md) for each document during the build process.
 * In development mode, you can access documents at their URL path with .md extension
 * (e.g., /foo/hello.md) to get the raw markdown without frontmatter.
 *
 * Markdown files are generated when:
 * - publishMarkdown is enabled (for copy button functionality)
 * - llmsTxt or llmsTxtFull is enabled (for generating llms.txt files)
 *
 * It also writes metadata to markdown-info.json used by the llms.txt generator.
